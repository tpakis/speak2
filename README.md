# Speak2

Local voice dictation for macOS. Hold the fn key (configurable) to speak, release to transcribe. Works with any application.

100% on-device using [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit) or [Parakeet](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio) - no cloud services, no data leaves your Mac.

## Speech Recognition Models

Speak2 supports two speech recognition models:

| Model | Size | Languages | Best For |
|-------|------|-----------|----------|
| **Whisper (base.en)** | ~140 MB | English only | Fast, accurate English transcription |
| **Parakeet v3** | ~600 MB | 25 languages | Multilingual users |

You can download both and switch between them from the menu bar. Only one model is loaded at a time to conserve memory.

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later
- Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3)

## Installation

### From DMG (recommended)
Download the latest .dmg from the [releases](https://github.com/zachswift615/speak2/releases) page and install.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zachswift615/speak2.git
cd speak2
swift build -c release
```

### Run

```bash
swift run
```

Or run the release binary directly:

```bash
.build/release/Speak2
```

## First Launch Setup

On first launch, a setup window will appear. You need to:

### 1. Grant Accessibility Permission

This is required for global fn key detection.

Click "Grant" next to Accessibility on the first launch window

<img width="466" height="183" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28d9d0f9-25fb-4d7a-9396-1fad03426128" />

Then click Open System Settings

<img width="468" height="55" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b80e39e-0dec-4a19-8a6e-517c9fd4d578" />

Then find speak2 in the list and toggle the permission switch on and authenticate with password or fingerprint. If Speak2 is not in the list, click the `+` button and nagivate to your Applications directory where you dragged it to install, and Add Speak2 to the list of apps.

#### Building from source

**Option A:** Add Speak2 directly
1. Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility**
2. Click the **+** button
3. Press **Cmd+Shift+G** and paste: `~/.build/release/Speak2` (or wherever you built it)
4. Select the Speak2 executable and enable it

**Option B:** Enable Terminal (easier for development)
1. Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility**
2. Find **Terminal** in the list and toggle it **ON**
3. This allows any app run from Terminal to use accessibility features

### 2. Grant Microphone Permission
Click "Grant" next to Microphone. And click "Allow" on the permission window that pops up. 

### 3. Download Speech Model

Choose a model and click "Download":
- **Whisper (base.en)** - ~140MB, English only, faster
- **Parakeet v3** - ~600MB, 25 languages, best for multilingual users

**Note:** Parakeet takes longer to load initially (~20-30 seconds) as it compiles the neural engine model. Subsequent loads are faster. The menu bar icon will show a spinning indicator while loading.

Once all three items show checkmarks, the setup window will indicate completion and you can close it.

## Usage

1. **Hold the fn key** - Recording starts (menu bar icon turns red)
2. **Speak** - Say what you want to type
3. **Release fn key** - Transcription happens (icon shows spinner), then text is pasted

The transcribed text is automatically pasted into whatever application text field has focus.

### Menu Bar

Speak2 runs as a menu bar app (no dock icon). Look for the microphone icon:

- **White/Black (depending on macOS theme)** - Idle, ready to record
- **Yellow spinning arrows** - Loading model
- **Red mic** - Recording in progress
- **Cyan spinner** - Transcribing

The menu shows a status line at the top indicating the current state (e.g., "Ready – Whisper (base.en)").

#### Switching Models
Click the menu bar icon and select **Model** to switch between downloaded models. Models not yet downloaded show a ↓ indicator - clicking them opens the setup window to download.

#### Manage Models
Click **Manage Models...** to open the setup window where you can download additional models or delete existing ones to free up disk space.

#### Choosing Hotkey
You can choose from several hotkey options. Sometimes external keyboards don't send the function key reliably. In that case, you can choose one of the other options from the menu.

#### Personal Dictionary

Speak2 includes a personal dictionary feature that helps improve transcription accuracy for names, technical terms, industry jargon, and unique spellings.

**Accessing the Dictionary:**
- Click the menu bar icon → **Dictionary** → **Manage Dictionary...** to open the full management window
- Click **Dictionary** → **Add Word...** for quick word addition

**Adding Words:**

Each dictionary entry can include:
| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Word | Yes | The correct spelling you want |
| Aliases | No | Common misspellings or mishearings (comma-separated) |
| Pronunciation | No | Phonetic hint if the word sounds different than spelled |
| Category | No | Organization (Names, Technical, Medical, etc.) |
| Language | Yes | Which language this word belongs to (25 languages supported) |

**How It Works:**

When you speak, the transcription is post-processed using your dictionary:
1. **Alias matching** - Direct replacement of known misspellings
2. **Phonetic matching** - Uses Soundex algorithm to catch similar-sounding words

For example, if you add "Anthropic" to your dictionary, words that sound similar (like "Antropik" or "Anthropik") will be automatically corrected.

**Right-Click Service:**

You can also add words directly from any application:
1. Select/highlight any text
2. Right-click → **Services** → **Add to Speak2 Dictionary**
3. Choose to add as a new word or as an alias to an existing word

> **Note:** The service may require logging out and back in to appear after first install.

**Import/Export:**

The dictionary can be exported to JSON and imported on another machine via the Manage Dictionary window.

#### Launch at Login
You can choose to have Speak2 launch at login. If selected, a checkmark will appear beside this option. Click it again to remove it from the list of start up apps. You'll see this when you choose the start up option:

#### Quit Speak2
Click the menu bar icon and click "Quit Speak2".

## How It Works

- **HotkeyManager** - Detects hotkey press/release using CGEvent tap
- **AudioRecorder** - Captures microphone audio at 16kHz mono PCM
- **ModelManager** - Handles model downloading, loading, and switching
- **WhisperTranscriber** - Runs WhisperKit on-device for speech-to-text
- **ParakeetTranscriber** - Runs FluidAudio/Parakeet on-device for speech-to-text
- **DictionaryProcessor** - Post-processes transcription using personal dictionary (alias replacement + phonetic matching)
- **TextInjector** - Copies transcription to clipboard and simulates Cmd+V to paste

The selected model stays loaded in memory (~300-600MB RAM depending on model) for instant transcription.

## Tips

- Speak naturally with punctuation inflection - Whisper handles periods, commas, and question marks based on your tone
- Keep recordings under 30 seconds for best performance
- First transcription may be slightly slower as the model warms up
- Add frequently used names and technical terms to your personal dictionary for better accuracy
- Use aliases for words that are commonly misheard (e.g., add "Kubernetes" with alias "Cooper Netties")

## Known Limitations

- Parakeet model takes ~20-30 seconds to load on first use (compiling neural engine model)
- Uses clipboard for text injection (temporarily overwrites clipboard contents)
- fn key detection requires Accessibility permission
- Only tested on Apple Silicon Macs

## Tech Stack

- Swift + SwiftUI
- [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit) - Apple's optimized Whisper implementation
- [FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio) - Parakeet speech recognition for Apple Silicon
- AVFoundation for audio capture
- CGEvent for global hotkey detection
